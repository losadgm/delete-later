== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Background and/or Motivation
| **Web-based Access** | The game must be accessible via a standard web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) without requiring local installation.
| **Public Deployment** | The application must be deployed and publicly accessible via the Web (academic delivery constraint).
| **Backend/Frontend Separation** | The logic (APIs/services) and the presentation (UI) must be decoupled to keep clear client/server boundaries and enable independent development.
| **Bot Implementation** | The system must include an algorithmic bot with selectable difficulty and/or multiple strategies (exact number of difficulty levels is not fixed).
| **Persistence** | A database or persistent storage must be used to save player profiles and game history.
| **YEN notation (JSON messages)** | Game state must be exchanged as JSON using YEN notation to ensure interoperability between modules.
|===

=== Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Background and/or Motivation
| **Team Structure** | Work is divided among students acting as a full-stack development team, requiring clear communication and task management.
| **Deadline** | The project must be completed and documented within the academic semester timeframe.
| **Technology adoption (learning curve)** | The project requires using technologies that are new to the team (e.g., Docker, TypeScript, Rust), which may affect planning and delivery.
|===

=== Conventions

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Background and/or Motivation
| **arc42 Documentation** | The software architecture must be documented using the arc42 template.
| **Version Control** | Use of Git (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) is mandatory to track progress and manage collaborative code changes.
| **YEN notation** | Use YEN notation in JSON messages whenever a game state is exchanged.

.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. 
These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.
