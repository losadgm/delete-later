.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms

.Form
A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

|===
|Term |Definition

|YOVI
|System name: a web-based platform to play Game Y through a browser and public APIs.

|Game Y
|Board game implemented by the system, including a player-vs-bot mode.

|Micrati
|Company behind the project in the assignment context (project sponsor).

|Web Frontend
|Browser-based TypeScript SPA that renders the board UI and interacts with backend APIs via HTTP (and WebSockets when enabled).

|SPA (Single-Page Application)
|Web application that loads once and updates the UI dynamically by calling backend APIs.

|webapp-backend
|Backend that exposes the public Game API and acts as orchestration layer (BFF) towards internal services (notably `gamey`) and the `users` service.

|BFF (Backend for Frontend)
|Pattern where a single backend endpoint is tailored to a specific frontend, centralizing orchestration and cross-cutting concerns.

|users (service)
|Service responsible for authentication and user management, exposing the public User API (e.g., register/login/profile) and persisting user data in MariaDB.

|User API (Public User API)
|Public HTTP API surface for user management (register/login/profile) provided by the `users` service.

|Game API (Public Game API)
|Public HTTP API surface for game interaction (match flow/play actions) provided by `webapp-backend`.

|gamey (Rust engine)
|Internal Rust service that validates game states and computes bot moves; invoked by `webapp-backend` via HTTP using JSON/YEN.

|YEN
|Notation used to represent a Game Y state (board size, players, turn, and layout), exchanged as JSON between services.

|YEN/JSON game state
|JSON payload that encodes the game state following YEN; invalid states must be rejected by the engine.

|JSON
|Default payload format used in the system APIs and service-to-service communication.

|REST
|HTTP-based style used for request/response APIs in the system.

|WebSocket
|Bidirectional communication channel used for realtime gameplay/multiplayer events when enabled.

|JWT (JSON Web Token)
|Token format used for authentication; clients send it via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

|HS256
|HMAC-SHA256 algorithm used to sign/verify JWTs using a shared secret.

|Authentication
|Process of proving identity (who a user/client is), handled by the `users` service via JWT issuance/verification.

|Authorization
|Process of deciding permissions (what a user can do), implemented as role-based checks (e.g., `player`/`admin`).

|Role (player/admin)
|User permission label used for authorization decisions.

|MariaDB
|Relational database used by the `users` service to persist user accounts and credentials/roles.

|ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
|Short document describing an important architectural decision, its context, and consequences.

|arc42
|Software architecture documentation template used to structure this documentation (sections 1–12).

|M1
|First milestone focused on end-to-end functionality.

|Error envelope
|Standard JSON structure for error responses using `errorCode`, `message`, and `requestId`.

|requestId
|Identifier included in error responses to correlate client-visible failures with server-side logs/traces.
